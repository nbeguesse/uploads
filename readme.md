Phonegap/Cordova 3.5.0
If you reinstall phonegap/cordova, you will need to update the whole app to match.

ripple emulate - open the URL in chrome to emulate. Everything but firing events works.

phonegap run android - will install on phone if phone is plugged in. Otherwise will launch Android Emulator (slow!!)
